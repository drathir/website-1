<h1>Network rules</h1>
<p>Things that are strictly prohibited are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical abuse: spam, flood, (D)DoS etc.</li>
<li>Things that are explicitly illegal in EU, USA or Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also try to not be a complete asshole. There are no rules against that, but that doesn't mean you have to be one.</p>
<p>In addition, channels can have their own rules. Enforcing those is fully up to the ops of those channels.</p>
