General info
============

HypeIRC is an IRC network aiming to be a free platform for both
Hyperboria-related and any other discussion as long as you don't
abuse the technical capabilities of the network or do something
that is explicitly illegal in western countries, where our nodes
reside: EU, Canada and USA.

Connect
=======

All servers listen only inside the [hyperboria network](http://hyperboria.net).  
We have several RDNS domains, connect to any of them via port 6667:

Notable channels are:
