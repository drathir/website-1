Network rules
=============

Things that are strictly prohibited are:

* Technical abuse: spam, flood, (D)DoS etc.
* Things that are explicitly illegal in EU, USA or Canada.

Also try to not be a complete asshole. There are no rules against that, but that doesn't mean you have to be one.

Furthermore, individual channels can have their own rules. Enforcing those is fully up to the ops of those channels.
